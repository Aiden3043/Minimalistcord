>WARNING: This theme is currently optimized for dark appearance settings. The light version works, but it is more prone to bugs. In its current state, it is recommended to use the dark theme until some issues are worked out.

Install it by putting the minimalistcord.css file into your BetterDiscord directory, found in the Roaming folder of your computer. The Roaming folder can be found by entering "%appdata%" in the Run prompt.
